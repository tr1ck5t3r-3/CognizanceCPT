## Problem Of The Day ( Binary to Grey )
Binary encoding while being implemented in the computer is prone to being exploited. To decrease the possibility of it being exploited, binary codes are converted into grey code. Binary code can be converted into grey by the following method:

Consider a 4 bit binary number where the bits are numbered as B3 to B0 from MSB to LSB, Then:

  -G3=B3
  -G2= B3 XOR B2
  -G1 = B2 XOR B1
  -G0 = B1 XOR B0

where G3 - G0 are bits of the grey code from MSB to LSB.
Example:

- Input Format
  - The first line contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases
  - The next T lines contain 1 integer N which must be converted to grey code.
